<H3>Whiplash</H3>
<p>
    The given movie tells about a guy who is driven and motivated to 
    demonstrate skills and knowledge about drums in band by Terence Fletcher.
    I loved the movie from the first sight since it is dynamic, intriguing, and powerful.
</p>
<H3>The Spirited Away</H3>
<p>
    This one holds special place in my heart because it is the first anime movie 
    that I've watched. At start, it was confusing and sensitive, but, as the movie went on, 
    I started to think about the behind scene meaning and how it is interconnected between real life.

<H3>Dr. House</H3>
<p>
    This tv-show is best I've ever seen since it presents with a lot of drama, shares insights about 
    complication of human body, and followed with an excellent plot and actors.

<h3>Avatar Aang & Korra</h3>
<p>
    This tv-show is very nostalgic and amazing in its own way because both demostrated an immense character 
    development, significantly improved their skills, and showed why avatars are important in the show.
